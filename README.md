# The Spark Foundation Tasks

## Data Science And Business Analytics Internship in The Sparks Foundation.


Internship Category : Data Science and Business Analytics

Internship Duration : 1 Month (June-2022)

Internship Type : Work from Home


### Task-1: Prediction using Supervised ML (Level-Beginner)

1.Predict the pre centage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

2.This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

3.Data can be found on http://bit.ly/w-data

4.What will be predicted score if a students studies for 9.25 hr/day ?

### Task-2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML(Level-Beginner)


From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Use K-means clustering for perform this task.

Data can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

### Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)

1.For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

2.The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

3.Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
